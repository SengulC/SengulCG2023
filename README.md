## Computer Graphics Coursework

This is my repository for the University of Bristol's Computer Graphics course where I coded the rendering of the Cornell Box and relevant animation techniques via C++ & SDL.

Below are the features I successfully implemented (including extensions to the base course material)
- camera movement
- Ray Tracing with shadows
- multi-light shadows
- hard, soft shadows
- ambient, diffuse, specular lighting
- Gouraud and Phong shading
- reflective surfaces
